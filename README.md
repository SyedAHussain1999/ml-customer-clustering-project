# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms

## Project Overview  
This project was completed as a focus on customer segmentation through unsupervised learning. The goal was to apply and compare multiple clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. The insights derived from this segmentation aim to inform targeted marketing strategies and product positioning decisions.

## Process Summary

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- The dataset was cleaned and prepared by addressing missing values and inconsistent data formats.
- Features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure scale uniformity.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality and enhance clustering interpretability.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizations and summary statistics were used to understand distributional patterns and potential segmentation indicators.
- Correlation analysis helped to uncover relationships between features before clustering.

### 3. Clustering Algorithms  
- Implemented and compared three clustering methods:
  - K-Means
  - Agglomerative Clustering (Hierarchical)
  - DBSCAN
- Optimal cluster counts were determined using:
  - Elbow Method
  - Silhouette Score Analysis
- PCA-transformed data was used to improve cluster separation and visual interpretation.

### 4. Cluster Interpretation  
- Each cluster was analyzed to identify distinguishing characteristics such as income, spending score, or demographic traits.
- Clusters were profiled to understand customer personas (e.g., high-spend young adults, low-income retirees, etc.).

### 5. Actionable Business Insights  
- Provided segmentation-based recommendations including:
  - Personalized promotions for high-value customers.
  - Cost-efficiency improvements through targeted outreach.
  - Differentiated service levels aligned with customer segment needs.

## Tools and Techniques Used  
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Models: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering  
- Techniques: PCA, Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis, Standard Scaling

## Business Relevance  
This project demonstrates how clustering can transform raw customer data into actionable segmentation strategies. The approach equips businesses to optimize marketing spend, personalize engagement, and drive stronger customer relationships.
